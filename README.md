# YEN Community Portal

Welcome to the official community hub for **YEN**! We're building a modern terminal for the AI-native developer.

This repository is for:

- **Bug Reports** — something not working as expected
- **Feature Fequests** — ideas for new functionality
- **Discussions** — questions, feedback, and general conversation

### Guidelines

- **Search first** — Check if your issue or idea already exists before creating a new one.
- **One issue per report** — Keep bug reports and feature requests focused on a single topic.
- **Be specific** — The more detail you provide, the better we can help.
- **Be patient** — We review all feedback, but response times may vary.
- **Be kind** — If you need a "Code of Conduct" then you're not our people.
