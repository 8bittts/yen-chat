## Guidelines

- **Search first** — Check if your issue or idea already exists before creating a new one.
- **One issue per report** — Keep bug reports and feature requests focused on a single topic.
- **Be specific** — The more detail you provide, the better we can help.
- **Be patient** — We review all feedback, but response times may vary.
- **Be kind** — If you need a "Code of Conduct" then you're not our people.

## Finding Your Version

Open YEN and check **YEN > About YEN** in the menu bar, or run:

```

defaults read /Applications/YEN.app/Contents/Info.plist CFBundleShortVersionString
